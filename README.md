## About Me

I'm an economist transitioning into Data Science, currently working as a Data Analyst Intern at IXConercio seccional XCB. My background in Economics provides me with a distinct advantage: the ability to bridge analytical rigor with strategic business insight. I specialize in translating complex datasets into actionable intelligence that drives decision-making. By combining econometric thinking with modern data science tools, I help organizations uncover patterns, optimize processes, and solve real-world problems with precision.
